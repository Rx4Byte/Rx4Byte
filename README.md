                                                     _the server still needs some work and is quite basic at the moment._

### 💬 Ask Me About:
Anything and everything! Seriously, feel free to throw your questions my way—whether it’s coding challenges, game design ideas, or even my favorite snack. I’m open to chat and share insights, so feel free to reach out! 😄✨


### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
Way too much! 😄 Most of my projects serve as a way to learn and improve my coding skills and language knowledge, especially in C++.


### 🌱 I’m Currently Learning:
I’ve just started diving into C++ and exploring various aspects of game development because I have a strong interest in creating games, especially my own. I enjoy focusing on game mechanics, design principles, and other foundational elements, although graphic design isn’t something I’m interested in. Every new skill I acquire boosts my creativity and helps me build engaging, immersive experiences. Overall, I’m passionate about expanding my skills and developing innovative projects!

<!-- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on -->
### 🤔 I’m looking for help or collaboration with: ​ ​ ​ > ​ ​ ​everyone
I always appreciate help and collaboration!  
Whether it’s brainstorming ideas, tackling challenges, or sharing insights, I believe that teamwork can lead to amazing results.
 
Even if I’m not the best at working with others, I’ll always try my best!  
However, my effectiveness tends to decrease significantly when I’m not alone or when I’m in social situations.  
If you’re still interested in collaborating or have any suggestions, I’d love to hear from you!  
Together, we can create something great! <3  

Just a heads up, there may be times when I’m not as interested, and I apologize in advance if that happens.  
Wishing you good luck and lots of fun!  

### My Language Toolbelt (in the order I used/"learned" them):
* **Assembly**  
    I started with cheat-engine assembly scripting (creating CE tables), where I discovered my interest in reverse engineering programs and games.  
    Making cheat tables is one of my hobbies! 🛠️

* **Lua**  
    I picked it up mainly for specific projects, starting with scripting in PAYDAY 2, but I’m not really a fan of this language. 😅

* **Python**  
    Just for fun! 😄 It may not be the most performant language, but it’s easy and quick to work with.  
    Writing in Python is always a good time, and it’s great for web scraping!

* **C#**  
    I have mixed feelings about it, but I find C# to be okay. I started using it for game modding and quickly discovered it’s useful for building tools. ⚙️

* **C++**  
    My favorite language so far! I just started learning it a few weeks ago. 🚀✨


## Thoughts & Reflections
### Quotes, Statements
**I’m Not a Philosopher, But These Statements Ring True:**
* Don’t just know things; it’s important to understand them as well!
* An idea is just the beginning. From it, you create a vision, and then you must take action!
* Don’t just think—act and experiment!
* No action means no results!


### Me:
**Feel free to skip if you're not interested in my story—I’ll still like you and wish you the best, even if you’d be my nemesis!**  

I’m a 26-year-old German developer and gamer. I enjoy playing PvP games like Counter-Strike and Apex Legends (even if it’s been a while since my last matches), and I’ve loved Halo along with many other games!

I may have some neurodivergence or just have some neurodivergent traits, but i see it as a strength or special ability, and unfortunately, due to my health, I’m currently a pensioner facing various challenges.  
I strive to focus on what I love and what I can do, but there are times when I need to take a step back to recover and prioritize my well-being.
During these times, nature and my cats help me immensely!  
Animals often bring more honesty and authenticity than many people do, and their companionship makes a significant difference in my life.

So, if I may be inactive for a while, please be patient.  
I will never disappear while I’m alive; I love what I do; I just need a break sometimes.


### ⚡ Fun Fact:
I’ve written enough lines of code to fill a book, but my to-do list is still longer than my code! 😄
